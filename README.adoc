== Intro

This plugin is a convenience wrapper around `'grepprg'` and `'grepformat'`,
supports most common grep tools, and is easily extendable.

You choose a tool, enter a search term, and get your matches into a quickfix
list.

If you use Neovim the search will be executed asynchronously. Thus you will be
able to continue editing while the grep program is still running.

Supports by default: *git grep*, *ag*, *pt*, *ack*, *grep*, *findstr*

== Mappings

There are no pre-defined mappings, but 2 `<plug>` mappings, that should be
used:

    nmap gs <plug>Grepper
    vmap gs <plug>Grepper

Now, gs in normal mode will prompt for a new search term and in visual mode
will adopt the current visual selection.

Use <tab> to iterate through all found grep programs.

TIP: Read `:h grepper` for more information about this plugin.

== Installation and Documentation

If you don't have a plugin manager, I suggest having a look at
link:https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.git[vim-plug]. Installation is a
breeze afterwards:

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-grepper'

Restart Vim or `:source $MYVIMRC`, then do `:PlugInstall`.
