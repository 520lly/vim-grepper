== Intro

This plugin lets you quickly iterate through all common grep programs. Missing
ones can easily be added.

A `:Grepper` command exists, but I suggest setting up proper mappings, e.g.

```vim
nmap <leader>g <plug>Grepper
xmap <leader>g <plug>Grepper
```

`<leader>g` in normal mode will prompt for a new search term and in visual mode
will adopt the current visual selection.

Use `<tab>` to iterate through the grep programs.

NOTE: If you're using link:https://github.com/neovim/neovim[Neovim] you'll get
async execution for free. Thus you'll be able to continue editing until the
grep program finishes.

== Installation and Documentation

If you don't have a plugin manager, I suggest having a look at
link:https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.git[vim-plug]. Installation is a
breeze afterwards:

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-grepper'

Restart Vim or `:source $MYVIMRC`, then do `:PlugInstall`.

TIP: Read `:h grepper` for more information about this plugin.
